##Final Project Proposal

**Title:** PursePal

**Members:** Amelia Soucy and Desayna Christmas 

**Objective:** Through this project, our goal is to provide a platform where consumers can easily view 10 different Michael Kors purses and ultimately add one (or many!) to their cart. Our visually appealing platform—an HTML page—will list, concisely describe, and depict the purse options, as well as allow consumers to access the purses on their home Michael Kors website through an API and database.
