# PursePal: Amelia and Desayna's Final Project

## Final Project Proposal

**Title:** AD's Michael Kors PopUp

**Members:** Amelia Soucy and Desayna Christmas 

**Objective:** Through this project, our goal is to provide a platform where consumers can easily view 10 different Michael Kors purses and ultimately add one (or many!) to their cart. Our visually appealing platform—an HTML page—will list, concisely describe, and depict the purse options, as well as allow consumers to access the purses on their home Michael Kors website through an API and database. 

**Tech Stack and Resources:**
- Demo code and notes from our class sessions:
    - HTML pages, CSS Styling, JavaScript demo
    - Amazon example
    - API example
    - FastAPI examples
- Homeworks:
    - Homework - Python Programming 1
    - Homework - Python Programming 2
    - Homework – API
    - Homework – Web
- ChatGPT
- GitHub support pages
- Michael Kors website: https://www.michaelkors.com/women/handbags/
- HTML online editor: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editor.asp
- Meeting with Professor Li via WebEx and asking Professor Li questions via Slack

## Project Overview

The purpose of our web application is to serve as a platform for users to easily view 10 different Michael Kors purses, being able to see and compare several details about the purses (their prices, pictures, etc.) and then to add the purse(s) of their choosing to their shopping cart.

- Desayna:
    - Front-end development, including the creation of the aesthetic and user-friendly HTML webpage using a CSS stylesheet and JavaScript aspects
